One thing we noticed in some of the light curves was that there were negative flux values. 
Another major issue for this dataset is missing measurements. Are there objects that are
completely missing observations in a given filter?
How can we use Python to automatically recognize the different features we saw,
and take a different action for each? In this lesson, we'll learn how to write code that
runs only when certain conditions are true.

## Conditionals

We can ask Python to take different actions, depending on a condition, with an `if` statement:

~~~
num = 37
if num > 100:
    print('greater')
else:
    print('not greater')
print('done')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
not greater
done
~~~
{: .output}

The second line of this code uses the keyword `if` to tell Python that we want to make a choice.
If the test that follows the `if` statement is true,
the body of the `if`
(i.e., the lines indented underneath it) are executed.
If the test is false,
the body of the `else` is executed instead.
Only one or the other is ever executed:

![Executing a Conditional](../fig/python-flowchart-conditional.png)

Conditional statements don't have to include an `else`.
If there isn't one,
Python simply does nothing if the test is false:

~~~
num = 53
print('before conditional...')
if num > 100:
    print(num,' is greater than 100')
print('...after conditional')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
before conditional...
...after conditional
~~~
{: .output}

We can also chain several tests together using `elif`,
which is short for "else if".
The following Python code uses `elif` to print the sign of a number.

~~~
num = -3

if num > 0:
    print(num, 'is positive')
elif num == 0:
    print(num, 'is zero')
else:
    print(num, 'is negative')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
-3 is negative
~~~
{: .output}

Note that to test for equality we use a double equals sign `==`
rather than a single equals sign `=` which is used to assign values.

We can also combine tests using `and` and `or`.
`and` is only true if both parts are true:

~~~
if (1 > 0) and (-1 > 0):
    print('both parts are true')
else:
    print('at least one part is false')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
at least one part is false
~~~
{: .output}

while `or` is true if at least one part is true:

~~~
if (1 < 0) or (-1 < 0):
    print('at least one test is true')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
at least one test is true
~~~
{: .output}

> ## `True` and `False`
> `True` and `False` are special words in Python called `booleans`,
> which represent truth values. A statement such as `1 < 0` returns
> the value `False`, while `-1 < 0` returns the value `True`.
{: .callout}

## Checking our Data

Now that we've seen how conditionals work,
we can use them to check for the suspicious features we saw in our inflammation data.
We are about to use functions provided by the `numpy` module again.
Therefore, if you're working in a new Python session, make sure to load the
module with:

~~~
import numpy
~~~
{: .language-python}

In some of the plots we saw negative fluxes. Let's flag the objects and the filters in which
these occur.
Let's do that!
However, instead of checking every single value, we can check the all columns at once:

~~~
if np.nanmin(data[:,1]) < 0:
    print('Negative fluxes!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

We also saw a lot of NaNs.
We can also check for this with an `elif` condition:

~~~
elif np.sum(np.isnan(data[:,1])) == data.shape[0]:
    print(f + ': A NaN column')
~~~
{: .language-python}

And if neither of these conditions are true, we can use `else` to give the all-clear:

~~~
else:
    print(f+': Seems OK!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Let's test that out:

~~~
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='data/03D3af.csv', delimiter=',', skiprows=1)


if np.nanmin(data[:,1]) < 0.:
    print(f + ': a negative flux')
elif np.sum(np.isnan(data[:,1])) == data.shape[0]:
    print(f + ': a NaN column')
else:
    print('Seems OK!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
data/03D3af.csv: A NaN column
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='data/03D1ar.csv', delimiter=',')

if np.nanmin(data[:,1]) < 0.:
    print(f + ': a negative flux')
elif np.sum(np.isnan(data[:,1])) == data.shape[0]:
    print(f + ': a NaN column')
else:
    print('Seems OK!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
data/03D1ar.csv: A negative flux.
~~~
{: .output}

In this way,
we have asked Python to do something different depending on the condition of our data.
Here we printed messages in all cases,
but we could also imagine not using the `else` catch-all
so that messages are only printed when something is wrong,
freeing us from having to manually examine every plot for features we've seen before.

> ## That's Not Not What I Meant
>
> Sometimes it is useful to check whether some condition is not true.

> ## In-Place Operators
>
> Python (and most other languages in the C family) provides
> [in-place operators]({{ page.root }}/reference/#in-place-operators)

> ~~~
> x = 1  # original value
> x += 1 # add one to x, assigning result back to x
> x *= 3 # multiply x by 3
> print(x)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}

> ~~~
> 6
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> Write some code that sums the positive and negative numbers in a list separately,
> using in-place operators.
> Do you think the result is more or less readable
> than writing the same without in-place operators?
>
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > positive_sum = 0
