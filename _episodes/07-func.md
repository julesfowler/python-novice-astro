At this point,
we've written code to draw some interesting features in our supernova data,
loop over all our data files to quickly draw these plots for each of them,
and have Python make decisions based on what it sees in our data.
But, our code is getting pretty long and complicated;
what if we had thousands of datasets,
and didn't want to generate a figure for every single one?
Commenting out the figure-drawing code is a nuisance.
Also, what if we want to use that code again,
on a different dataset or at a different point in our program?
Cutting and pasting it is going to make our code get very long and very repetitive,
very quickly.
We'd like a way to package our code so that it is easier to reuse,
and Python provides for this by letting us define things called 'functions' ---
a shorthand way of re-executing longer pieces of code.
Let's start by defining a function `fahr_to_celsius` that converts temperatures
from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

~~~
def fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))
~~~
{: .language-python}

![The Blueprint for a Python Function](../fig/python-function.svg)


The function definition opens with the keyword `def` followed by the
name of the function (`fahr_to_celsius`) and a parenthesized list of parameter names (`temp`). The
[body]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function-body) of the function --- the
statements that are executed when it runs --- is indented below the
definition line.  The body concludes with a `return` keyword followed by the return value.

When we call the function,
the values we pass to it are assigned to those variables
so that we can use them inside the function.
Inside the function,
we use a [return statement]({{ page.root }}/reference/#return-statement) to send a result
back to whoever asked for it.

Let's try running our function.

~~~
fahr_to_celsius(32)
~~~
{: .language-python}

This command should call our function, using "32" as the input and return the function value.

In fact, calling our own function is no different from calling any other function:
~~~
print('freezing point of water:', fahr_to_celsius(32), 'C')
print('boiling point of water:', fahr_to_celsius(212), 'C')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
freezing point of water: 0.0 C
boiling point of water: 100.0 C
~~~
{: .output}

We've successfully called the function that we defined,
and we have access to the value that we returned.


## Composing Functions

Now that we've seen how to turn Fahrenheit into Celsius,
we can also write the function to turn Celsius into Kelvin:

~~~
def celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c):
    return temp_c + 273.15

print('freezing point of water in Kelvin:', celsius_to_kelvin(0.))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
freezing point of water in Kelvin: 273.15
~~~
{: .output}

What about converting Fahrenheit to Kelvin?
We could write out the formula,
but we don't need to.
Instead,
we can [compose]({{ page.root }}/reference/#compose) the two functions we have already created:

~~~
def fahr_to_kelvin(temp_f):
    temp_c = fahr_to_celsius(temp_f)
    temp_k = celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c)
    return temp_k

print('boiling point of water in Kelvin:', fahr_to_kelvin(212.0))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
boiling point of water in Kelvin: 373.15
~~~
{: .output}

This is our first taste of how larger programs are built:
we define basic operations,
then combine them in ever-large chunks to get the effect we want.
Real-life functions will usually be larger than the ones shown here --- typically half a dozen
to a few dozen lines --- but they shouldn't ever be much longer than that,
or the next person who reads it won't be able to understand what's going on.

## Tidying up

Now that we know how to wrap bits of code up in functions,
we can make our supernova analysis easier to read and easier to reuse.
First, let's make an `analyze` function that generates our plots:

~~~
def make_plot(filename):

    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=filename, delimiter=',', skiprows=1)

    fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(15.0, 4.0))
    
    axes1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 4, 1)
    axes2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 4, 2)
    axes3 = fig.add_subplot(1, 4, 3)
    axes4 = fig.add_subplot(1, 4, 4)
    
    y_min = numpy.nanmin(data[:,[1,3,5,7]])
    y_max = numpy.nanmax(data[:,[1,3,5,7]])
    
    mjd = data[:,0]

    axes1.set_xlabel('MJD')
    axes1.set_ylabel('g')
    axes1.set_ylim([y_min, y_max])
    axes1.plot(mjd,data[:,1],'o', color='blue')

    axes2.set_xlabel('MJD')
    axes2.set_ylabel('r')
    axes2.set_ylim([y_min, y_max])
    axes2.plot(mjd,data[:,3],'o', color='green')

    axes3.set_xlabel('MJD')
    axes3.set_ylabel('i')
    axes3.set_ylim([y_min, y_max])
    axes3.plot(mjd,data[:,5],'o', color='yellow')

    axes4.set_xlabel('MJD')
    axes4.set_ylabel('z')
    axes4.set_ylim([y_min, y_max])
    axes4.plot(mjd, data[:,7],'o', color='red')

    #fig.tight_layout()
    matplotlib.pyplot.show(block=False)
    matplotlib.pyplot.savefig(filename.replace('.csv','.png'))
~~~
{: .language-python}

and another function called `detect_problems` that checks for those systematics
we noticed:

~~~
def detect_problems(filename):

    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=filename, delimiter=',', skiprows=1)

    for i in [1,3,5,7]:
        if np.nanmin(data[:,i]) < 0.:
            print(filename + ': A negative flux.')
        elif np.sum(np.isnan(data[:,i])) == data.shape[0]:
            print(filename + ': A NaN column')
        else:
            print('Seems OK!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Notice that rather than jumbling this code together in one giant `for` loop,
we can now read and reuse both ideas separately.
We can reproduce the previous analysis with a much simpler `for` loop:

~~~
filenames = sorted(glob.glob('data/*.csv'))

for f in filenames[:3]:
    print(f)
    make_plot(f)
    detect_problems(f)
~~~
{: .language-python}

By giving our functions human-readable names,
we can more easily read and understand what is happening in the `for` loop.
Even better, if at some later date we want to use either of those pieces of code again,
we can do so in a single line.

## Documenting

Once we start putting things in functions so that we can re-use them,
it is useful to add some documentation so that we remember what the function does.

The usual way to put documentation in software is
to add [comments]({{ page.root }}/reference/#comment) like this:

~~~
#fahr_to_celsius(temp):
#converts fahrenheit degrees to celsius degrees
def fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))
~~~
{: .language-python}

There's a better way, though.
If the first thing in a function is a string that isn't assigned to a variable,
that string is attached to the function as its documentation:

~~~
def fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    """Converts fahrenheit degrees to celsius degrees."""
    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))
~~~
{: .language-python}

This is better because we can now ask Python's built-in help system to show us
the documentation for the function:

~~~
help(fahr_to_celsius)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Help on function fahr_to_celsius in module __main__:

fahr_to_celsius(temp)
   Converts fahrenheit degrees to celsius degrees.
~~~
{: .output}

A string like this is called a [docstring]({{ page.root }}/reference/#docstring).
We don't need to use triple quotes when we write one,
but if we do,
we can break the string across multiple lines.

~~~
def fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    """
    Converts fahrenheit degrees to celsius degrees.
    Example:
    >fahr_to_celsius(125)
    37.77777777777778
    """
    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))

help(fahr_to_celsius)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Help on function fahr_to_celsius in module __main__:

fahr_to_celsius(temp)
    Converts fahrenheit degrees to celsius degrees.
    Example:
    >fahr_to_celsius(125)
    37.77777777777778
~~~
{: .output}

## Defining Defaults

We have passed parameters to functions in two ways:
directly, as in `type(data)`,
and by name, as in `numpy.loadtxt(fname='something.csv', delimiter=',')`.
In fact,
we can pass the filename to `loadtxt` without the `fname=`:

~~~
numpy.loadtxt('data/03D1ar.csv', delimiter=',',skiprows=1)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
array([[ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  3.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  2., ...,  1.,  0.,  1.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  1., ...,  2.,  1.,  1.],
       ...,
       [ 0.,  1.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  2.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  0.]])
~~~
{: .output}

but we still need to say `delimiter=`:

~~~
numpy.loadtxt('data/03D1ar.csv', ',',1)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/lib/npyio.py", line 1041, in loa
dtxt
    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
  File "/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_internal.py", line 199, in
_commastring
    newitem = (dtype, eval(repeats))
  File "<string>", line 1
    ,
    ^
SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
~~~
{: .error}

With that in hand,
let's look at the help for `numpy.loadtxt`:

~~~
help(numpy.loadtxt)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Help on function loadtxt in module numpy.lib.npyio:

loadtxt(fname, dtype=<class 'float'>, comments='#', delimiter=None, converters=None, skiprows=0, use
cols=None, unpack=False, ndmin=0, encoding='bytes')
    Load data from a text file.

    Each row in the text file must have the same number of values.

    Parameters
    ----------
...
~~~
{: .output}

There's a lot of information here,
but the most important part is the first couple of lines:

~~~
loadtxt(fname, dtype=<class 'float'>, comments='#', delimiter=None, converters=None, skiprows=0, use
cols=None, unpack=False, ndmin=0, encoding='bytes')
~~~
{: .output}

This tells us that `loadtxt` has one parameter called `fname` that doesn't have a default value,
and eight others that do.
If we call the function like this:

~~~
numpy.loadtxt('data/03D1ar.csv', ',',1)
~~~
{: .language-python}

then the filename is assigned to `fname` (which is what we want),
but the delimiter string `','` is assigned to `dtype` rather than `delimiter`,
because `dtype` is the second parameter in the list. However `','` isn't a known `dtype` so
our code produced an error message when we tried to run it.
When we call `loadtxt` we don't have to provide `fname=` for the filename because it's the
first item in the list, but if we want the `','` to be assigned to the variable `delimiter`,
we *do* have to provide `delimiter=` for the second parameter since `delimiter` is not
the second parameter in the list.

## Readable functions

Consider these two functions:

~~~
def s(p):
    a = 0
    for v in p:
        a += v
    m = a / len(p)
    d = 0
    for v in p:
        d += (v - m) * (v - m)
    return numpy.sqrt(d / (len(p) - 1))

def std_dev(sample):
    sample_sum = 0
    for value in sample:
        sample_sum += value

    sample_mean = sample_sum / len(sample)

    sum_squared_devs = 0
    for value in sample:
        sum_squared_devs += (value - sample_mean) * (value - sample_mean)

    return numpy.sqrt(sum_squared_devs / (len(sample) - 1))
~~~
{: .language-python}

The functions `s` and `std_dev` are computationally equivalent (they
both calculate the sample standard deviation), but to a human reader,
they look very different. You probably found `std_dev` much easier to
read and understand than `s`.

As this example illustrates, both documentation and a programmer's
_coding style_ combine to determine how easy it is for others to read
and understand the programmer's code. Choosing meaningful variable
names and using blank spaces to break the code into logical "chunks"
are helpful techniques for producing _readable code_. This is useful
not only for sharing code with others, but also for the original
programmer. If you need to revisit code that you wrote months ago and
haven't thought about since then, you will appreciate the value of
readable code!
